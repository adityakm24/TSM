If you want just a basic contact form look somewhere else, we are here for the complex ones.

== Description ==

You have three ways to create a complex form (when you are not a developer):

- Learn to code because most likely you will either need to create filters, modify php code or add javascript to your form.
- Hire a developer that do the form for you
- Use this plugin =)

Why am I so sure? Because:

1. The plugin already have a bunch of options that will allow you to do 99% of all the forms you want
2. What happens to that 1%? **if the plugin is missing something I will add it, and fast** this plugin is the fastest evolving plugin out there and is focused in making your dram forms come true. If you cant do something PLEASE let me know.


### More features in the free version than any other

Not only the free version has almost 40 fields in it (including file upload, signature, Google Maps and repeater fields which are typically locked by other plugins) you will find a lot of features that, if available, they most likely are locked away from the free version in other plugins, like calculations, a bunch of conditional logic, entries screen, multiple steps, style designer, custom restrictions and much more.

Don't get me wrong, we also lock stuffs, but we made sure that the free version is rock solid and enough in many cases.

### The best calculation builder you have ever seen

Have you tried to do a calculation in a form? If so you might encounter any of these problems (and I know because I have tries almost any for builder out there):

- It doesn't support calculations
- It support calculations but just basic arithmetical operations and maybe a few small conditions
- It support complex calculations but you either need to deal with their horrible calculation designer (which most of the time is just a text box) or you need to put on your php/javascript hat because you are going to need it.

Is there a better way? I am pleased to say, YES! Our calculation builder (which honestly... is also a text box... but with superpowers!) is smart enough to understand what you are typing, it will highlight you the errors and color your formula so you don't get lost in it. It also provide you with a contextual helper that you can use to do particular actions with a field.

For example, maybe you have an address field and just want to retrieve the city? You just need to add the field in your form and put a dot (.) in front of it, when you do that the plugin will give you a list of operations that you can do with your field (including retrieving just the city)

Did I mention that **you can do more than just filling a field with your calculations**? You can use these calculations to do a lot more stuffs like setting the minimum date of a date picker, the maximum value of a numeric field or even use it in a show/hide or validation condition.

**All or this is included in the free version!** but if you have the essential add-on you can go even further and call a third party service or execute shortcodes within your formulas! You can also use our function builder to create your own function and use them in your formulas or even yet, just picke one from our function gallery, you could for exmaple, install a function that do an operation similar to excel.


### A great style designer

If you are a web designer you might be more comfortable using css for styling your form (which you can do using the css tab) but if you have no clue what a css rule or selector is you can just use our style designer. With it you can change the appearance of each field or the whole form, you can change their color, change the font, add a background, include some gradients and much more.

You can even use formulas to create conditions and do neat stuffs like (just to give an example) making a field invalid if the number of days between two dates is less than 10.
